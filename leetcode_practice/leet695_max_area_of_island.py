"""
You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's
(representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.)
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected
4-directionally.
